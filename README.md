# Heart Attack Risk Assessment using Neural Networks

The following project predicts the risk of having a heart attack based on the user input. All the information needed to train the predictive model was extracted from Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fajobgiua/heart-attack-risk-assessment-dataset

### Overview:

- Dataset import, data types and structure visualization
- Splitting the dataset into two parts: one for input features and one for output labels, which represent our prediction target
- Use of `MLPClassifier` and `MultiOutputClassifier` to define and train a neural network for multiple output prediction


**Note:**

To generalize the results and improve accuracy, it would be necessary to include more data on a wider range of patient profiles — similar to those in the dataset — but with different lifestyles, nationalities, and other characteristics.
